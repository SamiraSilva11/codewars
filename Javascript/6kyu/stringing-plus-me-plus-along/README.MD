# "Stringing"+"Me"+"Along"

**DESCRIPTION:**

Implement a function that receives a string, and lets you extend it with repeated calls. When no argument is passed you should return a string consisting of space-separated words you've received earlier.

**Note:** There will always be at least 1 string; all inputs will be non-empty.

### For example:

```
createMessage("Hello")("World!")("how")("are")("you?")() === "Hello World! how are you?"
```

Tip (helpful, but not necessary): Try using classes!

Good luck and happy coding!
