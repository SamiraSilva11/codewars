# Create Phone Number

**DESCRIPTION:**

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example

```
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
