# Is your period late?

**DESCRIPTION:**

In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.

Our function will take three parameters:

last - The Date object with the date of the last period

today - The Date object with the date of the check

cycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days

Return true if the number of days passed from last to today is greater than cycleLength. Otherwise, return false.
