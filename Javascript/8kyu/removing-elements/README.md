# Removing Elements

**DESCRIPTION:**

Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

### Example:


`["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...]` -> `["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]`


None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
