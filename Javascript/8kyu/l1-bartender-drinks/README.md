# L1: Bartender, drinks!

**DESCRIPTION:**

Complete the function that receives as input a string, and produces outputs according to the following table:


|Input | Output|
| ------------ | ------------ |
|"Jabroni" | "Patron Tequila"
|"School Counselor"|"Anything with Alcohol"
|"Programmer"|"Hipster Craft Beer"
|"Bike Gang Member"|"Moonshine"
|"Politician"|"Your tax dollars"
|"Rapper"|"Cristal"
|*anything else* |"Beer"

**Note:** anything else is the default case: if the input to the function is not any of the values in the table, then the return value should be `"Beer"`.

Make sure you cover the cases where certain words do not show up with correct capitalization. For example, the input `"pOLitiCIaN"` should still return `"Your tax dollars"`.
