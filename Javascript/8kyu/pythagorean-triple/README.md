# Find the Slope

**DESCRIPTION:**

Given an **unsorted** array of 3 positive integers [ n1, n2, n3 ], determine if it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using those 3 integers.

A Pythagorean Triple consists of arranging 3 integers, such that:

a2 + b2 = c2

### Examples

[5, 3, 4] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 32 + 42 = 52

[3, 4, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 32 + 42 = 52

[13, 12, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers: 52 + 122 = 132

[100, 3, 999] : it is NOT possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers - no matter how you arrange them, you will never find a way to satisfy the equation a2 + b2 = c2

### Return Values

- For Python: return True or False
- For JavaScript: return true or false
- Other languages: return 1 or 0 or refer to Sample Tests.
