# SpeedCode #3 Ã— Fun with ES6 Classes #5 - Dogs and Classes

**DESCRIPTION:**

Preloaded for you is a `class Dog`:

```
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = species;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = size;
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = loyal;
  }
}
```

You are then given a working `class Labrador` as your initial code.

```
class Labrador {
  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = "Labrador";
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = "Large";
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = true;
  }
}
```

**Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.**

Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself. Are you ready? Ready, get set, GO!!! :D
