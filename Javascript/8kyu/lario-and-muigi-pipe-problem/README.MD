# Lario and Muigi Pipe Problem

**DESCRIPTION:**

### Issue

Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around and damaging your stages again.

The `pipes` connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before you receive any more complaints.

The `pipes` are correct when each `pipe` after the first is `1` more than the previous one.

### Task

Given a list of unique `numbers` sorted in ascending order, return a new list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).

### Example

`Input:  1,3,5,6,7,8` `Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`
