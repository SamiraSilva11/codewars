# Cat years, Dog years

**DESCRIPTION:**

### Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was `humanYears` years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [`humanYears`,`catYears`,`dogYears`]

#### NOTES:

- `humanYears` >= 1
- `humanYears` are whole numbers only

### Cat Years

- `15` cat years for first year
- `+9` cat years for second year
- `+4` cat years for each year after that

### Dog Years

- `15` dog years for first year
- `+9` dog years for second year
- `+5` dog years for each year after that
