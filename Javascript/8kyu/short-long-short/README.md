# Short Long Short

**DESCRIPTION:**

Given 2 strings, `a` and `b`, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be the same length, but they may be empty ( `zero` length ).

Hint for R users:

>*The length of string is not always the same as the number of characters*

### For example: (Input1, Input2) --> output
```
("1", "22") --> "1221"
("22", "1") --> "1221"
```
