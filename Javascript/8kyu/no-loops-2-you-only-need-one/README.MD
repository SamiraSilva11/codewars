# No Loops 2 - You only need one

**DESCRIPTION:**

*** No Loops Allowed ***

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

Array can contain numbers or strings. x can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.
