# Add Length

**DESCRIPTION:**<br>

What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

## Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

**Note:** String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
