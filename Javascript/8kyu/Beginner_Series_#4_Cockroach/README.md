# Beginner Series #4 Cockroach

**DESCRIPTION:**

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:
```
1.08 --> 30
```
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
