# Arguments to Binary addition

**DESCRIPTION:**

Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum; to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be addeded as 0 since it can't be addeded.

If your language can handle float binaries assume the array won't contain float or doubles.

```
arr2bin([1,2]) == '11'
arr2bin([1,2,'a']) == '11'
arr2bin([]) == '0'

NOTE: NaN is a number too in javascript for decimal, binary and n-ary base
```
