# ES6 string addition

**DESCRIPTION:**

It is easy to join two strings together like this `string1 + string2`.

Another way to get the desired result would be with `string1.concat(string2)`

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

`+` , `.concat()` & `.join()` will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.
