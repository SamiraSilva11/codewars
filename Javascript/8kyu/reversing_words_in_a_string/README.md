# Reversed Strings

**DESCRIPTION:**

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

### Example (Input -> Output)

```
"Hello World" --> "World Hello"
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"
```
Happy coding!
