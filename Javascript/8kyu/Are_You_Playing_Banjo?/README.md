# Are You Playing Banjo?

**DESCRIPTION:**

Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
```
Names given are always valid strings.
