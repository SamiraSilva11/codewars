# Remove the time

**DESCRIPTION:**

### Task Description

You're re-designing a blog, and the blog's posts have the `Weekday Month Day, time` format for showing the date and time when a post was made, e.g., `Friday May 2, 7pm`.

You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, `Weekday Month Day` that omits the time.

Write a function that takes the website date/time in its original string format and returns the shortened format.

### Input

Input will always be a string, e.g., `"Friday May 2, 7pm"`. 

### Output

Output will be the shortened string, e.g., `"Friday May 2"`.
