# Area or Perimeter

**Instructions:**
You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square. If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

## Example:
Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):
6, 10 --> 32
3, 3 --> 9

**Note:** for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
