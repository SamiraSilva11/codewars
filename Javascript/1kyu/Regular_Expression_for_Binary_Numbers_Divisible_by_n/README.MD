# Regular Expression for Binary Numbers Divisible by n
**DESCRIPTION:**<br>
#### Regular Expression for Binary Numbers Divisible by n
Create a function that will return a regular expression string that is capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only 1s and 0s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by n.

#### Tests
Inputs 1 <= n <= 18 will be tested

Each n will be tested against random invalid tests and random valid tests (which may or may not pass the regex test itself, accordingly).

#### Notes
- Strings that are not binary numbers should be rejected.
- Keep your solution under 5000 characters. This means you can't hard-code the answers.
- Only these characters may be included in your returned string:
- 01?:*+^$()[]|

#### Javascript Notes
- Do not include the regex caps /.../. Your string will be used as such: RegExp(regexDivisibleBy(3)) in the tests.
- No funny business! There should be no need for prototyping, so don't even think about it.
