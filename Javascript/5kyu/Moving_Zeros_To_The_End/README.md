# Moving Zeros To The End

**DESCRIPTION:**

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

```
moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
```
