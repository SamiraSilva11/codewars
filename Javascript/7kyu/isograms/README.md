# Isograms

**DESCRIPTION:**

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

### Example: (Input --> Output)

```
"Dermatoglyphics" --> true
"aba" --> false
"moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)
```
