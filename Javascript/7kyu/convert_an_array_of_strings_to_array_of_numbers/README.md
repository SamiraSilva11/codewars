# Convert an array of strings to array of numbers

**DESCRIPTION:**

Oh no!

Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an *sequence of strings*!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:`["1", "2", "3"]` to `[1, 2, 3]`

Note that you can receive floats as well.
