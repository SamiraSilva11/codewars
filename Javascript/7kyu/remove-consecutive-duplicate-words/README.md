# Remove consecutive duplicate words

**DESCRIPTION:**

Your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate words from a string, leaving only first words entries. For example:

```
"alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta"

--> "alpha beta gamma delta alpha beta gamma delta"
```

Words will be separated by a single space. There will be no leading or trailing spaces in the string. An empty string (0 words) is a valid input.
