# From A to Z

**DESCRIPTION:**

Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter.
Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!

### Examples

```
"a-z" ➞ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
"h-o" ➞ "hijklmno"
"Q-Z" ➞ "QRSTUVWXYZ"
"J-J" ➞ "J"
```

### Notes

- A hyphen will separate the two letters in the string.
- You don't need to worry about error handling in this kata (i.e. both letters will be the same case and the second letter will not be before the first alphabetically).
