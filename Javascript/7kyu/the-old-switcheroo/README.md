# The old switcheroo

**DESCRIPTION:**

Write a function

```
vowel2index(str)
```

that takes in a string and replaces all the vowels [a,e,i,o,u] with their respective positions within that string.
E.g:

```
vowel2index('this is my string') == 'th3s 6s my str15ng'
vowel2index('Codewars is the best site in the world') == 'C2d4w6rs 10s th15 b18st s23t25 27n th32 w35rld'
vowel2index('') == ''
```

Your function should be case insensitive to the vowels.
