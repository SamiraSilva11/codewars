# Alphabet symmetry

**DESCRIPTION:**

Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter `a` is in position `1` and `b` is in position `2`. In the alphabet, `a` and b are also in positions `1` and `2`. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions `4` and `5`.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

```
solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]
```

See test cases for more examples.

Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.

Good luck!
