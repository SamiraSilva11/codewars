# Unique string characters

**DESCRIPTION:**

In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

### Example:
```
solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
```

Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.

More examples in the tests cases.

Good luck!
